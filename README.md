### 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **AI Answer Evaluator**  
  Built a system that evaluates printed answer sheets using object detection.  
  ✅ Auto-grading logic using Python and OpenCV  
  ✍️ Adding custom OCR for handwritten text  
  🤖 LLM chatbot integration (handled by teammate)

- **SimAgroBots**  
  A crop simulation project that predicts health and yield using ML models.  
  📊 Gives smart suggestions based on predictions — no IoT hardware used.

- **Multimodal Emotion Detector**  
  An AI system that predicts human emotions using multiple physiological inputs (like pulse, temperature, etc.).  
  🧠 Combines sensor signals and ML for real-time emotion tracking.

- **Car Parking App**  
  A React Native mobile app that shows nearby parking spots using Google Maps and custom markers.  
  📍 Includes detail screens, user location, and **Firebase** for managing app data.
